        Users typically reuse the same personalized identification number (PIN) for multiple systems and in numerous sessions. Direct PIN entries are highly susceptible to shoulder-surfing attacks as attackers can effectively observe PIN entry with concealed cameras. Indirect PIN entry methods proposed as countermeasures are rarely deployed because they demand a heavier cognitive workload for users. To achieve security and usability, we present a practical indirect PIN entry method called SteganoPIN. The humanâ€“machine interface of SteganoPIN is two numeric keypads, one covered and the other open, designed to physically block shoulder surfing attacks. After locating a long-term PIN in the more typical layout, through the covered permuted keypad, a user generates a one-time PIN that can safely be entered in plain view of attackers. SteganoPIN is resilient to camera-based shoulder-surfing attacks over multiple authentication sessions. It remains limited to PIN-based authentication.
